```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

I finally did it. I actually made a blog. The focus of this blog will be things I am familiar with and passionate about:


  * The intersection of science and policy as it relates to water. 
  * Exploration of the science and evidence behind controversial topics
  * Cycling

I'll likely deviate from this theme on occassion, but will try to keep the focus there.

That being said, here is some test R code so I make sure things are working alright:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
